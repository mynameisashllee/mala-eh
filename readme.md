# _má là xiāng guō_
_food_
a spicy stir-fried sichuan dish where you can choose your own ingredients!

imagine you and your friends are all absolute fiends for mala... but eating it somehow never works out, because planning is so hard. automate this dreary task so you'll never have to argue about rice vs noodles in your mala EVER again!!

mala-eh is a pun of the singaporean expression _"walao eh"_ expressing surprise or annoyance (something we'll hopefully never feel again with this app).
